# RandomPhoto
This code was written in swift with the intension of showing the user a new image on a button click while also changing the background color.

<img src="https://github.com/luisadrianpuga/RandomPhoto/blob/main/randomPhotos.ss.PNG" width="350" height="600"/>

# Pending Bug Fixes
- The background color changes before the image.
- It seems like the images get repeated twice.
